# Assumptions and Conclusions for Chicago_Crimes

1) Year based/date based crimes:
a) crimes count per year and is there any comparitative reduction/increase it?
b) Does the crimes took place on any national holidays/specific months like christmas month etc?
- so that we can alert police to have more prevention/protection during that period
## The above 2 can be linked up with location/community/iurc to get more conclusions as below

2) Types of crimes occurred (iurc based) :
a) major types of crimes occurred and is there a relation in between the count of crime types and time (years)
{may be increase in the usage of special kind of weapons/ specific type of a crime over the years}
- so that police/public can suspect on such type of crime causing types (iurc_primary_types)
* we can conclude by joining like this - (1a+2a) , (1b+2a)
3) Location/community Based Crime Rates :
a) Least to highest crime affected areas(communities) as well as Least to highest crime affected locations
- by this we can conclude the safest to unsafe living areas over Chicago so that willing people can shift

towards those ones and also we can say where the police staff/stations to be increased
b) we can also find (community wise VS location wise) crime rate such that we can have more alerts/precaution
kind of things in such locations specific to those communities
* Further conclusions can also be made by â€“ (1a+3a), (1b+3a), (2a+3a), (1a+2a+3a)
4) Schools VS Crime_Rates :
a) Based on (3a) and the schools present in those areas we can set more/improve precautionary measures over
such schools of those communities
b) IURC_Primary_type(crime_type) VS schools by which we can conclude the type of crimes being happening
over the school areas and insist schools/communities(which have more schools) to have advanced checkups/increased
police staff/at least 1 guard per school based on the crime rate
* we can also join as (1a+2a+4a), (1b+4b)
##Based on the conclusions drawn from all the above points, we can further conclude on the police staff increment or
warn police for more precautions or warn the head of police department for fining/dismissal of certain locality police
staff for their the improper duties.
